This research seeks to explore what various pathways are available for interested people to access and learn about computing, what learning experiences through those pathways retain them in computing, and what implications those pathways bring to computing careers. This work particularly focused on populations from historically marginalized populations in computing with a long-term goal of developing inclusive tools, programs, and assessments to support them. 

Works and Publications including:
* Alternative Pathways for Non-computing Women
* Understanding Computing Pathways of Those Least Represented
* Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science - Additional Undergraduate Pathways to Computing
