Some students' experiences are still missing out on the dominant narratives in engineering and computing education. This work aims to shed light on those underrecognized experiences in the current research foci in engineering and computing education to holistically seek solutions with an asset-based approach for broadening participation efforts. 
* Understanding The Experiences Of Non-Computing Women's Transitions Into Computing Careers: this study explores students who, later in their life trajectories, would like to explore computing without computing backgrounds.
* Characterizing the postdoctoral experiences in engineering and computing education
