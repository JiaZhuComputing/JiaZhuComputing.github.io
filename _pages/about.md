<span style="color:orange"> *I study the underrecognized experiences and pathways for broadening participation*</span>
=====
I am a Postdoctoral Scholar for the [LEARN-CS research group](https://moniqueross.com) in the [Department of Engineering Education](https://eed.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University (OSU)](https://www.osu.edu). Before joining OSU, I earned a doctoral degree in Computer Science and a master's degree in Data Science with a concentration in computational data analytics from the [Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Science (KFSCIS)](https://www.cis.fiu.edu) at [Florida International University (FIU)](https://www.fiu.edu). I also hold B.S. and M.S. degrees in Hospitality Management from the [Chaplin School of Hospitality and Tourism Management](https://hospitality.fiu.edu/) at FIU. My research interests include computing education, engineering education, educational data mining, and data science. 
    
Research
======
My work aims at broadening participation with a focus on exploring computing access points for women, improving the computing educational experience, and creating an inclusive computing ecosystem. During my years as a Ph.D. student, I have been a graduate research assistant for Dr. Monique Ross and have published nine papers at annual conferences, including the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE), IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), ACM Conferences on International Computing Education (ICER), and the ACM Technical Symposium on Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE). I have also been awarded the National Science Foundation (NSF) INTERN grant to conduct a research internship with the Journal of Engineering Education (JEE). During this internship, I explore Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) trends within JEE publications to support the broadening participation mission of JEE's strategic planning.
