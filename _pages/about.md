<span style="color:orange">"***She teaches with equity in mind and studies the underrecognized pathways into computing***"</span>

Hi there! Iâ€™m Jia, an Assistant Teaching Professor at [Northeastern Universityâ€™s Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/). Iâ€™m passionate about inclusive, student-centered teaching and research that highlights the *underrecognized experiences and pathways* students take into the computing field. Prior to this role, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar for the [LEARN-CS research group](https://moniqueross.com) in the [Department of Engineering Education](https://eed.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University (OSU)](https://www.osu.edu). I engage with interdisciplinary communities across computing education, engineering education, data science, educational data mining, learning analytics, and AI in education. At the heart of my work is a commitment to create learning environments where *ALL* students feel seen, supported, and empowered to thrive. 

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science with a research focus on computing education with [Dr. Monique Ross](https://people.engineering.osu.edu/people/ross.1982) and a master's degree in Data Science with a concentration in computational data analytics from the [Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Science (KFSCIS)](https://www.cis.fiu.edu) at [Florida International University (FIU)](https://www.fiu.edu). Before transitioning into computing and computing education research, I spent years conducting research and developing training programs in the hospitality industry. I also hold B.S. and M.S. degrees in Hospitality Management from the [Chaplin School of Hospitality and Tourism Management](https://hospitality.fiu.edu/) at FIU.
