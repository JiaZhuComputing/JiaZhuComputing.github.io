<span style="color:orange"> *I study the underrecognized experiences and pathways for broadening participation*</span>
=====
I am a Postdoctoral Scholar for the [LEARN-CS research group](https://moniqueross.com) in the [Department of Engineering Education](https://eed.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University (OSU)](https://www.osu.edu). My research interest is in exploring and studying the underrecognized experiences and pathways for broadening participation in computing. I engage with computing education, engineering education, STEM education, and educational data mining communities. 

I earned a doctoral degree in Computer Science with a research focus on computing education with Dr. Monique Ross and a master's degree in Data Science with a concentration in computational data analytics from the [Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Science (KFSCIS)](https://www.cis.fiu.edu) at [Florida International University (FIU)](https://www.fiu.edu). Before transitioning into computing and computing education research, I spent years conducting research and developing training programs in the hospitality industry. I also hold B.S. and M.S. degrees in Hospitality Management from the [Chaplin School of Hospitality and Tourism Management](https://hospitality.fiu.edu/) at FIU. 
    
Research
------
As a computing education researcher, I utilize mixed methods and computational methods to explore ***underrecognized experiences*** and ***pathways*** for broadening participationin computing. My work aims to expand computing access points for women, improve the computing educational experience, and create an inclusive computing ecosystem. My research has been published in leading venues in computing education and engineering education, including the ACM Conferences on International Computing Education (ICER), the ACM Technical Symposium on Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE), American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE), and IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE). I have also been awarded the National Science Foundation (NSF) INTERN grant in 2023 to conduct a research internship with the Journal of Engineering Education (JEE).
