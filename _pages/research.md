My research
------
As a computing education researcher, I utilize a broad range of quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods, and computational approaches to holistically explore ***underrecognized experiences*** and ***pathways*** for broadening participation in computing. My work aims to expand computing pathways for women, improve the computing educational experience, and create an inclusive computing ecosystem. My research has been published in leading venues in computing education and engineering education, including the ACM Conferences on International Computing Education ([ICER](https://dl.acm.org/conference/icer)), the ACM Technical Symposium on Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education ([SIGCSE](https://dl.acm.org/conference/sigcse)), American Society of Engineering Education ([ASEE](https://www.asee.org/home)), and IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference ([FIE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/1000297/all-proceedings)). I have also been awarded the [National Science Foundation (NSF) INTERN](https://www.nsf.gov/eng/eec/intern.jsp) grant in 2023 to conduct a research internship with the Journal of Engineering Education ([JEE](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/21689830)). 

### Below is a list of the selected projects I have worked on 

#### Studying Underrecognized Experiences in Engineering and Computing Education
===
 * Understanding the experiences of non-computing women's transitions into computing careers
 * Characterizing engineering and computer science postdoctoral experiences 
    
#### Exploring Pathways for Broadening Participation in Computing
===
 * Categorizing the alternative pathways for non-computing women transitioning into computing careers
 * Cracking the diversity: understanding computing pathways of those least represented
 * Investigating the implications on employability of the Bachelor of Arts in CS program: a potential additional undergraduate pathway to Computing
    
#### Computational Methods in Engineering and Computing Education Research
===  
 * Utilizing Web Scraping to inform pedagogical practices in computing education
 * Applying natural language processing techniques to explore hidden expectations in postdoctoral job postings
 * Employs a bibliometric NLP approach to evaluate publication keywords in computer science education
