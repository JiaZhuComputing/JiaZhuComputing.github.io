Imagine my research journey as a trip through a vast, intellectual marketplace full of theories and methods that could shape my work in computing and engineering education. Just like in a store, I pick up items along the way—some catching my eye instantly, others requiring more thought. This ***research cart*** I carry functions like a *shopping cart*, where I gather theories and methods that intrigue me, even if I’m not ready to "purchase" them for my current project.

Each theory or method added to this cart represents a piece of knowledge that I’ve come across on my path as a researcher. While I might not need it today, I know its value could become clear down the road. And that’s the beauty of this process: as I evolve in my research, I can always circle back to these stored items, diving deeper and determining if they fit into my future work.

This collection is more than just a list - it’s a personal resource curated over time, where every item holds potential for future exploration and discovery.
